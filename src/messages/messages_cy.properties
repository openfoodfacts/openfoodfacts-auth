# units for link expiration timeout formatting
# for languages which have more unit plural forms depending on the value (eg. Czech and other Slavic langs) you can override unit text for some other values like described in the Java choice format which is documented here. For Czech, it would be '{0,choice,0#minut|1#minuta|2#minuty|2<minut}'
