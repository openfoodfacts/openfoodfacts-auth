# Themes

The OpenFoodFacts theme is in the off directory. The other directories are a copy of the default themes that come with Keycloak and are extracted here purely for reference.

To refresh the default Keycloak themes run `make refresh_themes`

Note that the messages in the from-off folder are refreshed automatically from the Open Food Facts language and country taxonomies and should not be manually edited.

Only the messages in the common folder should be translated with Crowdin.
